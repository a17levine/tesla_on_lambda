# Tesla on Lambda

This [Jets](https://rubyonjets.com/) project allows you to create public endpoints for your Tesla vehicle powered by AWS Lambda. This allows you to use Siri to command your vehicle to turn on the HVAC by saying "hey Siri, start my car". 

Lambda has such a generous 'free tier' that you will not likely see any charges on your AWS bill, so it's free! Lambda functions are kept alive by the Jets framework to avoid cold starts.
